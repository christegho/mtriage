# Introducing Development Cycles 

As of 2020, I'm aiming to keep mtriage development to a regular, two-week
release cycle.

At the start of each cycle, I'll put some issues on the [release cycle project
board](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/mtriage/projects/1), and then
merge them into the [release](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/mtriage/tree/release)
branch as the code is written and reviewed. At the end of each cycle, I'll
merge the release branch into the [master](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/mtriage/tree/master)
branch, and then this goes on wash-rinse-repeat every two weeks.



## Status
Mtriage is currently a tool that we are using internally at [Forensic
Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org) primarily to orchestrate one
particular workflow, the deployment of computer vision classifiers on public
domain images and video. [This post](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/cv-in-triple-chaser)
goes into greater detail about that how that workflow works.

Mtriage's main development over at least the next few months will be aimed at
consolidating its use in this particular capacity. I know that there is some
use of mtriage as an orchestration tool for other workflows, i.e. to create
labelled datasets for machine learning, and these are definitely uses that we
are interested in discussing and supporting in the future. Mtriage is intended
as a tool to orchestrate computational workflows beyond just the initial
application in computer vision, but we need to refine that one first before
moving onto others.

## Cycle 1

The first cycle will begin February 1st, and end on February 15th. It will
focus on parallelising both selectors and analysers, and making the Etype
system more flexible.
